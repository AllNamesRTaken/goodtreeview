- Use IndexedTree to support quickly finding a node based on the row number.
- Extend Tree and IndexedTree with Take(x) to loop over the current and following x-1 nodes in order to have a vertical viewport
- Use Depth() to get indentation on viewport nodes. (Optimize in Tree later)
- Let RowInfo be a Partial property of data containing: (optimize later into separate structure in a dictionary keyed on node id)
  - RowKind = "d"
  - (Collapse)State = "off"
  - Freeze = 0
  - Height = [DEFAULT_HEIGHT]
- Let ColInfo[] be a Partial property of data containing: (optimize later into separate structure in a dictionary keyed on node id and cell index)
  - Name = ""
  - Header = true
  - Pos = "auto"
  - Width = [DEFAULT_WIDTH]
  - Filter = false
  - DataType = "auto"
- Make TreeView render the whole table to ViewPort
- Make TreeView render visible rows of ViewPort to Dom
- Add Headers (table on top of table ?)
- Add Column Freeze (position absolute + overflow-x scroll)
